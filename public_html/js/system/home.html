                        <p>sisane is a project whose aim is to provide you a template to ease the building of small and medium AJAX projects with the following technologies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Server: J2EE servlets, MySQL, Gson, Maven, POJOS from query or table (sisane-server server)</li>
                            <li>Client: Javascript, Angular 1.x</li>
                            <li>Json: foreign keys expansion</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Because software development trends naturaly to be complex sisane wants to be easy and keep simple all the process. sisane is used to teach web application development to vocational students and to qualify them to join the workforce market of developers in a tiny period of time. sisane was designed to avoid spaghetti code and complexity as far as possible, and brings an aid in structurate code development.</p>
